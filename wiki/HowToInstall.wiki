#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

This page shows how to install tsDyn and compile it from sources.


= Details =

Currently, the version 0.6 is in the CRAN repository and hence easily avalaible. For those who want nevertheless the newest functionnalities, you will have to download and compile it yourself. 

=Get the source=
This is very easy when you use subversion (you have to install it) and allows you to have always the newest version. Just create an directory called tsdyn:

{{{mkdir tsdyn}}}

go into it:

{{{cd tsdyn}}}

and dowload it: 

{{{svn checkout http://tsdyn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tsdyn-read-only}}}

No each time you want the new version just go in the directory and type:

{{{svn update}}}

=Compile it=
Now you have the source package you will want to make it readable for R, you have to go to the directory ({{{cd tsdyn}}}) and enter:

{{{sudo R CMD INSTALL tsDyn}}}

prompt your password and this will be done. You will have maybe some dependency problems (tsDyn *depends* on mgcv, Matrix, minpack.lm, rgenoud, *recquires* nnet, tseriesChaos, tseries, utils and *suggests*: tcltk, sm, scatterplot3d, rgl).
