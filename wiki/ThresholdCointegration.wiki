= Introduction =

This page shows the features for threshold cointegration and threshold vector error correction model in package tsDyn. These functions will be released in the next version of package tsDyn, currently work is done on their correct class implementation but the functions can already be used. To see how to access and compile the unreleased working sources, see this [HowToInstall page]. For bugs and comments, please contact Matthieu _dot_ Stigler (at) "gmail dot com"


= Functions =
 * Estimation of threshold vector error correction model (TVECM) by OLS (Seo 2007). Function *TVECM()*. 

 * Estimation of threshold vector error correction model TVECM) by MLE (Hansen and Seo). Function: *HanSeo_TVECM()*.

 * Estimation of threshold vector autoregressive model (TVAR) by OLS (Hansen and Seo 2002). Function: *TVAR()*. 

 * Estimation of linear VAR and VECM models. Function *linear2*. 

 * Linear vs threshold cointegration test of Hansen and Seo (2002). Contained in  *HanSeo_TVECM()*.

 * No cointegration against threshold cointegration test of Seo (2006) Function *TVECM_SeoTest()*

 * Linearity test of Hansen (1997) and its extension to multivariate case by Lo and Zivot (2002) Functions *setarTest()* and *TVAR_LRtest()*

 * Function to simulate and bootstrap TAR and TVAR. Functions *TAR_simul()* and *TVAR_simul()*

 * Simple Wald test for the coefficients. To be soon added. 


=Method implementation=
Following the method oriented programming from R, class are written for the functions (currently TVAR, TVECM and linear2) and entails following methods:
 * print(),
 * fitted(), 
 * coef(), 
 * summary(), 
 * AIC(), 
 * BIC(), 
 * residuals(), 
 * deviance(), 
 * logLik(), 
 * and a nice toLatex() export function.
