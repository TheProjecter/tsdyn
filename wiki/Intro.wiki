== Actual features of version 0.6  ==

TsDyn is a R package designed to modeling nonlinearities in time series. It entails following *nonlinear regression models*:

 * Smooth transition regression model. Function *star()*
 * Logistic smooth transition regressions models. *lstar()*
 * Threshold autoregressive models *setar()*
 * Neural Network nonlinear autoregressive model *nnet()*
 * Additive nonlinear autoregressive model *aar()*

It has also various *nonlinearity and independence tests* like:

 * Casdagli test of nonlinearity via locally linear forecasts *llar()*
 * Generic NLAR linearity test *isLinear()*

And finally the usual methods implemented in R, especially a nice function to export to LateX format the regression output (see *toLatex()*).


==Documentation==
A short guide is bundled, once installed type

> vignette('tsDyn')

at the R prompt. 

== Next release 0.7 ==

The next release will entail new models and nonlinearities tests, like an extension of the TAR model to multivariate case TVAR, [ThresholdCointegration threshold cointegration] estimation and tests, a bootstrap univariate and multivariate linearity test, and a flexible coefficient smooth transition regression models which also allows for linearity testing.
