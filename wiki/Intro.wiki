== Actual features of version 0.6  ==

TsDyn is a R package designed to modelling nonlinearitiies in time series. It entails following *nonlinear regression models*

 * Smooth transition regression model (_star_)
 * Logistic smooth transition regressions models (_lstar_)
 * Threshold autoregressive models (_setar_) 
 * Neural Network nonlinear autoregressive model(_nnet_)
 * Additive nonlinear autoregressive model (_aar_)

It has also various *nonlinearity and independance tests* like:

 * Casdagli test of nonlinearity via locally linear forecasts (_llar_)
 * Generic NLAR linearity test (_isLinear_)

And finally the usual methods implemented in R, especially a nice function to export to LateX format the regression output (see _toLatex()_). 


==Documentation==
A short guide is bundled, once installed type

at the R prompt. 

== Next release 0.7 ==

The next release will entail new models and nonlinearities tests, like an extension of the tar model to multivariate case, with also threshold cointegration estimation and tests, a bootstrap univariate and multivariate linearity test, and a flexible coefficient smooth transition regression models which also allows for linearity testing.
