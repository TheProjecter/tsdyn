== Actual features of version 0.6  ==

TsDyn is a R package designed to modelling nonlinearitiies in time series. It entails following *nonlinear regression models*

 * Smooth transition regression model (star)
 * Logistic smooth transition regressions models (lstar)
 * Threshold autoregressive models (setar and tar) 
 * Neural Network nonlinear autoregressive model(nnet)
 * Additive nonlinear autoregressive model (aar)

It has also various *nonlinearity and independance tests* like:

 * Casdagli test of nonlinearity via locally linear forecasts (llar)
 * Generic NLAR linearity test (isLinear)

And finally the usual methods implemented in R, especially a nice function to export to LateX format the regression output (see toLatex()). 


==Documentation==
A short guide is bundled, once installed type

at the R prompt. 

== Next release 0.7 ==

The next release will entail new models and nonlinearities tests, like an extension of the tar model to multivariate case, with also threshold cointegration estimation and tests, a bootstrap univariate and multivariate linearity test, and a flexible coefficient smooth transition regression models which also allows for linearity testing.
