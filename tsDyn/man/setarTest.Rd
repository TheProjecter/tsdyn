\value{A object of class "Hansen99Test" containing:

-The residual Sum of squares of model AR, 1 threshold TAR and 2 thresholds TAR (SSRs)

-The Ftest statistic for the test (Ftests)

-The bootstrap Pvalues (PvalBoot) and critical values (CriticalValBoot) for the test selected, and all Ftest computed (Ftestboot)

-The thresholds for the original series, obtained from search for 1 thresh (firstBests) and conditional search for 2 thresh (secBests)

-The number of bootstrap replications (nboot), the lags used (m) and the type of test (type)

\details{
Estimation of the first threshold parameter is made with CLS, a conditional search with one iteration is made for the second threshold. The Ftest comparing the residual sum of squares (SSR) of each model is computed.


 \deqn{
F_{ij}=T( (S_{i}-S_{j})/S_{j} )}

where \eqn{S_{i}} is the SSR of the model with i regimes (and so i-1 thresholds). 

Three test are avalaible. The both first can be seen as linearity test, whereas the third can be seen as a specification test: once the 1vs2 or/and 1vs3 rejected the linearity and henceforth accepted the presence of a threshold, is a model with one or two thresholds preferable?

Test \bold{1vs}2: Linear AR versus 1 threshold TAR

Test \bold{1vs}3: Linear AR versus 2 threshold2 TAR

Test \bold{2vs3}: 1 threshold TAR versus 2 threshold2 TAR  

The both first are computed together and avalaible with test="1vs". The third test is avalaible with test="2vs3". 

The homoskedastik bootstrap distribution is based on resampling the residuals from H0 model (ar for test 1vs, and setar(1) for test 2vs3), estimating the threshold parameter and then computing the Ftest, so it involves many computations and is pretty slow.
